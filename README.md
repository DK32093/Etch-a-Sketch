# Etch-a-Sketch

I created this project while working through the curriculum of The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/

I applied what I learned about HTML, CSS, and Javascript (including DOM manipulation) to create a webpage that functions similarly to an Etch-A-Sketch. The color of each box in the grid randomly changes as you mouse over them and the opacity decreases by 10% with each pass.
